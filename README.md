# Analyzing-st-peters-burg-Unique-mix


Cities are dynamic and diverse ecosystems with businesses of all sizes playing an important role in economic growth and employment creation. The distribution of business across different regions in a city can provide useful insights about the diversity of the businesses and most importantly the economic growth created by all those individual businesses.
In this project, we are focusing on St. Petersburg, which is a city on the Florida’s gulf coast and part of the Tampa Bay area. St. Pete is a lively city with a range and variety of businesses and sectors. Our goal is to examine the diversity of businesses that exist in the city’s eight corridors and provide a detailed assessment of the commercial landscape of those eight corridors. We map the distribution of these businesses by the type of the sector and location using data analysis and visualization techniques and identifying various patterns which may help new investors or entrepreneurs to establish businesses.
This analysis highlights the distinct characteristics of each corridor. This research of ours aims identify the potential opportunities of growth , innovation and investment. 
For this project we used Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool. It provides a wide range of tools and methods for visualizing the data, by which we can several gain insights for the data provided. Our goal is get the percentage of all the businesses in a particular corridor, we used several techniques in Power BI to extract this information from the dataset provided.

Importing the dataset into Power BI
The obtained dataset is pre-processed and cleaned by deleting duplicates using python. All the duplicates and null values were removed from the dataset before importing it into the Power BI environment.  

Visualizing using Power BI
Using the column and row data in the dataset, two dashboards are created in Power BI. 

The First Dashboard is an interactive dashboard with the ability to apply several filters to visualize the data. The total percentage of the kinds of industries in all the corridors is shown using a pie chart. Additionally, a map of these corridors which highlights the location of the businesses in the corridors is displayed. The second dashboard, contains a table which shows the percentage of mix of businesses in a particular corridor. The data in the columns can be sorted in order to see which business is leading in a specific corridor.
